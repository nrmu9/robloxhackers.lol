# What happened?
Voxlis (formerly known as Cola/hyperspeed) backstabbed me, because he got too greedy. I won't go into the details but he basically:
- Took away ownership everywhere he can away from me (Firebase, etc).
- Stole the source code and claims it as his own now even though (as seen from the commit & pull request history) I've done everything.
- Replaced ads on the website with his own, so he can take all the profit for himself after I've got the website to a (relatively) stable state now.
